An odd collection of dotfiles and scripts collected over years…
Not the best curation, but my creation.

Eventually I wish to shape this into something much better, with aliases
outside of bashrc, with environment variables set in a pam-accessible non-bash
script too.

scripts under ./bin may have been sourced elsewhere, attributions are contained
within.
files under ./patches are for system file tweaking, like `etc-sudoers`, but
wont be automatically applied during install because they can be destructive.

`initialise` should be run just after git cloning, on a pretty fresh install.
For best results, do this in a terminal session rather than GUI, or you’ll be
working to tidy duplicate XDG locations up. The tool should avoid being
destructive, and will refuse to run twice, but accidents can and may happen, so
be aware of that. `sudo` is used once to copy a motd script into a system
location, that is all.
